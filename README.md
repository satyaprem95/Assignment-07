Rational Number Operations Program:

This Java program takes user input for two rational numbers and performs various operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on them.
Additionally, it compares the two numbers, converts one of them to a floating-point value, and finds the absolute value of one of the numbers.
It includes error handling to check if either of the denominators is zero or if there's any issue with the input format, such as non-integer inputs.
It catches these errors and displays appropriate error messages.
Factorial Calculation Program:

This Java program prompts the user to input a number for which it calculates the factorial.
It computes the factorial of that number using a custom factorial calculation method from the Factorial class.
It includes error handling to check for issues with the input format, such as non-integer inputs or if the factorial of a negative number is attempted.
It catches these errors and displays appropriate error messages.
String Matching Program:

This Java program prompts the user to input a string.
It then checks if the entered string is equal to the word "BooM" using a custom method from the checkStr class.
However, there seems to be a logical flaw because it always prints "The word entered is equal to BooM" regardless of the actual comparison result.
Additionally, it should throw a NoMatchException if the entered string doesn't match "BooM", but the code provided doesn't seem to reflect this behavior properly.
